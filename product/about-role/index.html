<h2 id="what-a-product-owner-does" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-a-product-owner-does">What a product owner does</a></h2>
<p>The product owner is accountable for maximising the value of the product resulting from the work of the delivery team. How this is done may vary widely across organisations. Typically, at the NHSBSA we work to Agile and Scrum frameworks and principles. We also structure teams as defined in the GOV Service Manual and work to meet Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) and NHS service standards.</p>
<p>Product owners shape and steer the product towards a vision and will take feedback and influence from stakeholders within the organisation, users, and the market to ensure the development team is building the right thing.</p>
<h4 id="product-owners-are-accountable-for" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#product-owners-are-accountable-for">Product owners are accountable for:</a></h4>
