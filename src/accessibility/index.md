## Introduction

The NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) has a legal and moral duty to make its services accessible and inclusive. Accessibility is about more than compliance, it’s about making sure everyone can access the information and services they need, without barriers. By removing those barriers, we can create services that work better for everyone.

## Accessibility law

Accessibility is a part of several laws and standards the NHSBSA must follow. Each of the standards feed into the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance) and the [Public Sector Equality Duty](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-sector-equality-duty).

Whether your website or mobile application is used by staff or open to the public it will need to be accessible.

If you are building anything that runs in a browser, we will need it to meet the [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018 (PSBAR)](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/accessibility-law/the-public-sector-bodies-accessibility-regulations-2018).

## How to meet the requirements
To be legally compliant, your website or mobile application will need to:
- meet the latest published version of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/accessibility-law/web-content-accessibility-guidelines)
- publish a compliant [accessibility statement](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/accessibility-law/accessibility-statements)

### The Government accessibility requirements

To pass a service assessment your service needs to:

- meet the latest published version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
- publish a compliant accessibility statement
- include users with disabilities in user research
- be tested with [common assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies)

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
WCAG is a list of criteria your website or mobile application need to meet to be legally compliant with PSBAR. The latest published version of WCAG is [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).

The WCAG criteria are divided into three levels: A, AA and AAA. Each level builds on the one before it, so to meet AA, your product must meet all the A and AA criteria.

For your website or application to be compliant, it needs to meet the level of AA.

WCAG has 55 criteria at levels A and AA. This can feel like a lot, but some criteria only apply if your service uses features like video or audio.

While the official guidelines can be dense with technical information, there are user-friendly versions with plain English explanations and practical examples that make them easier to follow:

- [GOV.UK accessibility testing guide](https://github.com/alphagov/wcag-primer/wiki) - Features explanations of WCAG criteria written in plain English, with examples of passes and failures
- [How to meet WCAG (Quick reference) - W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref)

#### The four WCAG principles

WCAG 2.2 is a list of success criteria. Each one is specifically designed to consider a particular user need, but will fit into one of the following 4 categories:

- **Perceivable** – information must be visible or audible (e.g. text alternatives for images, not relying on colour to convey information)
- **Operable** – users must be able to interact with it (e.g. navigating to all interactive components using only a keyboard)
- **Understandable** – content must be clear and predictable (e.g. forms tell you what went wrong)
- **Robust** – works across devices and assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers, voice controllers, screen magnifiers)

## How many people?

## What we expect from suppliers
When we build or buy any digital product we need to:

- meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA as a minimum
- include an accessibility statement and evidence of accessibility testing
- provide a roadmap for fixing issues and making ongoing improvements
- accessibility must be considered across the end-to-end user journey, including any content, documents or outputs generated by the software
- updates must be designed, developed and tested for accessibility before release
- if the product includes authoring tools, suppliers must provide guidance or features to help us create accessible content using their system

### Accessibility overlays
Some companies offer “accessibility overlays” or “widgets” that claim to make a service accessible by adding a toolbar or a single line of code. These tools can sometimes fix very minor issues, but they do not make a service compliant with accessibility law.

Overlays often create new barriers for assistive technology users, and they do not address the underlying issues in the code. Accessibility must be built into the design and development of a product, not added afterwards.

For this reason, the NHSBSA does not accept overlays as a solution. We expect accessibility to be part of your design, development, and testing processes.
