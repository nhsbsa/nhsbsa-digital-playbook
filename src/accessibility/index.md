The NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) has a legal and moral duty to make its services, websites, documents and other digital products accessible and inclusive. Accessibility is about more than compliance, it’s about making sure everyone can access the information and services they need, without barriers. By removing barriers, we can create digital products that work better for everyone.

## Think about accessibility from the start
In the UK, 1 in 5 people have a disability - this could be visual, hearing, motor (affecting fine movement) or cognitive (affecting memory and thinking).

The concept of accessibility does not just apply to disabled people - all users will have different needs at different times and in different circumstances. Someone’s ability to use a service could be affected by their:

- location - they could be in a noisy cafe, sunny park or area with slow wifi
- health - they may be tired, recovering from a stroke or have a broken arm
- equipment - they could be on a mobile phone or using an older browser

Accessibility is about making sure your service can be used by as many people as possible. Thinking about this from the beginning will help you:

- make sure that nobody is excluded
- find out earlier if any parts of your service are not accessible - problems usually cost less to fix if you find them early

## Accessibility law

Accessibility is a part of several laws and standards the NHSBSA must follow. Each of the standards feed into the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance) and the [Public Sector Equality Duty](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-sector-equality-duty).

Whether your website or mobile application is used by staff or open to the public, it will need to be accessible.

If you are building anything that runs in a browser, it will need to meet the [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018 (PSBAR)](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/accessibility-law/the-public-sector-bodies-accessibility-regulations-2018).

## How to meet the regulations
To be legally compliant, your website or mobile application will need to:
- meet the latest published version of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/accessibility-law/web-content-accessibility-guidelines).
- publish a compliant [accessibility statement](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/accessibility-law/accessibility-statements)

### The Government accessibility requirements

To pass a service assessment your service needs to:

- meet the latest published version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
- publish a compliant accessibility statement
- include users with disabilities in user research
- be tested with [common assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies)

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

WCAG is a collection of success criteria your website or mobile application need to meet to be legally compliant with PSBAR. The latest published version of WCAG is [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).

The WCAG success criteria are divided into three levels: A, AA and AAA. Each level builds on the one before it, so to meet AA, your product must meet all the A and AA success criteria.

For your website or application to be compliant with accessibility regulations, it needs to meet the level of AA.

WCAG has 55 success criteria at levels A and AA. This can feel like a lot, but some criteria only apply if your service uses features like video or audio for example.

While the official guidelines can be dense with technical information, there are user-friendly versions with plain English explanations and practical examples that make them easier to follow:

- [Department for Education WCAG explorer](https://accessibility.education.gov.uk/guidelines/wcag/explorer)
- [How to meet WCAG (Quick reference) - W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref)

#### The four WCAG principles

WCAG 2.2 is a list of success criteria. Each one is specifically designed to consider a particular user need, but will fit into one of the following 4 categories:

- **Perceivable** – people must be able to take in the information using the senses available to them. For example, providing text alternatives for images and not using colour alone to convey meaning.
- **Operable** – people must be able to use all features of the service. For example, users should be able to navigate and interact using only a keyboard.
- **Understandable** – content and interactions must be clear, consistent and predictable. For example, forms should explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
- **Robust** – services must work with a range of devices, browsers and assistive technologies. For example, screen readers, voice control software, screen magnifiers or high contrast modes.

## Accessibility statements

You need to publish an accessibility statement to explain how accessible your website or mobile app is. Your accessibility statement must tell people how compliant the product or website is in meeting the declared level of conformance with WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards.

Your statement needs to cover:
- whether your website or mobile app is ‘fully’, ‘partially’ or ‘not’ compliant with accessibility standards
- if it’s not fully compliant, which parts of your website or mobile app do not currently meet accessibility standards and why (for example, because they are exempt or it would be a disproportionate burden to fix things)
- how people can get alternatives to content that’s not accessible to them
- how to contact you to report accessibility problems - and a link to the website that they can use if they’re not happy with your response.

The statement must declare one of following:
- Fully compliant - All pages of the product or website meets all of the WCAG level A and AA success criteria in full.
- Partially compliant - One or more, but less than half, of the WCAG Level A and AA success criteria have not been met.
- Non-compliant - More than half of all WCAG Level A and AA success criteria have not been met.

## How many people?
Our users are all different. They use different devices, browsers, and assistive technologies. Some will have access needs you can’t see.

## What we expect from suppliers
When we build or buy any digital product we need to:

- meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA as a minimum
- include an accessibility statement and evidence of accessibility testing
- provide a roadmap for fixing issues and making ongoing improvements
- accessibility must be considered across the end-to-end user journey, including any content, documents or outputs generated by the software
- updates must be designed, developed and tested for accessibility before release
- if the product includes authoring tools, suppliers must provide guidance or features to help us create accessible content using their system

### Accessibility overlays
Some companies offer “accessibility overlays” or “widgets” that claim to make a service accessible by adding a toolbar or a single line of code. These tools can sometimes fix very minor issues, but they do not make a service compliant with accessibility law.

Overlays often create new barriers for assistive technology users, and they do not address the underlying issues in the code. Accessibility must be built into the design and development of a product, not added afterwards.

For this reason, the NHSBSA does not accept overlays as a solution. We expect accessibility to be part of your design, development, and testing processes.
