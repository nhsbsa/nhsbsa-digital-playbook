Product owners play a key role in service assessments, making sure digital services meet user needs and align with organisational goals. They represent the service during assessments, making sure it meets the required standards and guidelines.

## Discovery phase playback

### Role of the product owner:

- Make sure all necessary documentation and evidence are ready for the playback.
- Present the findings and outcomes of the discovery phase to the service owner and other stakeholders.
- Keep stakeholders informed and involved in the process.

### Responsibilities:

- Compile and organise documentation, including user research findings, problem statements and initial hypotheses.
- Prepare a clear and concise presentation that outlines the activities and outcomes from the discovery phase.
- Answer any questions from the service team or stakeholders about research methods, findings and decisions made.

## Alpha phase assessment

### Role of the product owner:

- Demonstrate the prototypes developed during the alpha phase and explain the rationale behind them.
- Show how user feedback was collected and integrated into the prototypes.
- Present evidence of the technical feasibility and business viability of the proposed solutions.

### Responsibilities:

- Prepare a demonstration of the prototypes, highlighting key features and user interactions.
- Document and present user feedback and how it influenced the iterations.
- Provide evidence of technical feasibility, including any technical spikes or proof of concept work.

## Beta phase assessment

### Role of the product owner:

- Present the results of the private beta phase, including user feedback and performance metrics.
- Show how the product was iterated based on pilot feedback.
- Demonstrate that the product is ready for a wider release.

### Responsibilities:

- Compile and present data on user engagement, feedback, and any issues encountered during private beta.
- Document the changes made to the product based on pilot feedback.
- Provide a plan for public beta, including risk mitigation and support strategies.

## Live phase assessment

### Role of the product owner:

- Demonstrate the product is ready to move beyond public beta into live.
- Present key performance indicators (KPIs) and user feedback from public beta, and demonstrate how the data has been used to improve the service.
- Show how the product’s performance will be monitored and improved after it goes live.
- Make sure the product meets all necessary standards and compliance requirements.
- Present the plan for user support and ongoing maintenance after the product is launched.

### Responsibilities:

- Document the support and maintenance plan, including how user feedback will continue to be collected and addressed.
- Provide a plan for ongoing performance monitoring and continuous improvement.
- Gather and present data on product performance, user satisfaction, and any issues addressed during public beta.
- Document the iterative improvements made to the product.
- Make sure all compliance and accessibility standards are met and provide evidence of this.

The product owner makes sure that service standards are met and embedded throughout every phase of the product's lifecycle.

This involves:

- incorporating the service standards into the initial product vision and roadmap to make sure they align from the outset
- continuously applying service standards during the development phase to maintain focus on user needs, accessibility and security
- making sure all testing phases, including alpha and beta, rigorously evaluate the product against the service standards
- verifying the product meets all service standards before going live, ensuring a seamless and compliant user experience
- regularly reviewing and updating the product to maintain compliance with service standards, incorporating user feedback and new requirements

By embedding the service standards at every stage, the product owner ensures the delivery of high-quality, user-centered digital services that meet government expectations and provide value to users.
