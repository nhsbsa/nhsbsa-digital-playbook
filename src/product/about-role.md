## What a product owner does

The product owner is accountable for maximising the value of the product resulting from the work of the delivery team. How this is done may vary widely across organisations. Typically, at the NHSBSA we work to Agile and Scrum frameworks and principles. We also structure teams as defined in the GOV Service Manual and work to meet Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) and NHS service standards.

Product owners shape and steer the product towards a vision and will take feedback and influence from stakeholders within the organisation, users, and the market to ensure the development team is building the right thing.

#### Product owners are accountable for:

- the successful delivery of user centred products
- defining the product strategy and vision – in line with service vision and objectives
- owning the product roadmap and product backlog, bridging the gap between strategy and development
- managing the backlog with input from the team, ensuring the backlog is mature and there are clearly defined priorities and sprint goals
- making strategic and tactical product decisions
- planning for and participating in service assessments (all stages including planning and assessment itself)
- managing competing priorities, adapting to meet both internal and external user's needs
- using product management principles and approaches to capture and translate user needs into deliverable outcomes for users
- defining the minimum viable product (MVP)
- monitoring product quality and setting appropriate objectives and key results (OKRs) and key performance indicators (KPIs)
- using expertise to understand and communicate scope and constraints to manage expectations with all stakeholders. For example, user centered design (UCD) and development team

#### Product owners do not:

- create or own the delivery plan
- manage or dictate team tasks
- breakdown areas of work into tasks and stories in Jira
- manage scope for sprints
- determine the priority for the business – they work with the business to prioritise based on all information available to them
- act as subject matter experts for the service
