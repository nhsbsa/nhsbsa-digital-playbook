## Reporting pages  
  
The layout of the reporting pages are used as a guide of what a layout could look like.  
  
    
### General layout  
  
Features of the reporting pages include the following:  
- A filter section: in the example shown this is on the left. Filters as best practice should either be on the left-hand side or as a banner across the top of the page. Considerations on the real estate of the page are important to consider in placing filters. Global filters should be prioritised and included first in this section, with more specific filters following below. Specific filters relating to a singular chart should be placed close to the chart on the right-hand side opposite the title of the chart. Please consult the filter guidance for further information.
- A ‘clear selection’ button in the top right-hand side of the screen is optional. This is to allow the user to quickly remove any filters applied and ensure that the report can be quickly set to be unfiltered should a user need this.
- A separation line has been included to clearly define sections.  
  
    
### Summary/highlights example page  
  
The summary/highlights page should be a straightforward summary page which informs the user of key insights and important insights to note.  
  
The example template includes the following:  
- KPI cards for some initial summary statistics.
- A sensible header layout, following the visual hierarchy. For example, header 1 then header 2 within the same section.
- Charts should help give further information to the summary statistics shown.
- In the top right-hand corner there is a nudge to look further into the details of the data, helping to guide the user on their journey.

### Insight example page 1  
  
This potential layout includes an automated narrative section to help draw out key aspects to the user, and help tell a story of the data. In addition, if actions can be automatically generated for the user this would help maximise the meaningful insights and decisions generated as a result of the report.

### Insight example page 2  
  
This potential layout includes an insight generator to help encourage the user to ask questions, interrogate and explore the data further.
