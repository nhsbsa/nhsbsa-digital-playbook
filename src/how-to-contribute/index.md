## Vision

The playbook holds information about how we design, build and run services in the NHSBSA so that people know what to do while working here.

## Principles

It is __open__. The articles are stored in an open source repository, and published on the internet without any access protection. Anyone can read it.

It is __specific__ to how we work at the NHSBSA, but __general__ enough to apply across different services.

It is __readable__, like a book but also as a __reference__. Articles should stand alone and convey enough valuable information to be worthwhile.

## Users

We should consider these core users when writing content:

* __NHSBSA Staff__ (Digital, Data and Technology): The people who deliver our services
* __External suppliers__: The people we entrust to deliver services on our behalf
* __Cross Government agencies and organisations__: Experts in relevant professions who can help us to improve

## What should be included in the playbook?

* __Standards__
  To define our requirements in service delivery.
* __Guides__
  To explain how to do things at the NHSBSA.
* __Tool choices__
  To clarify our preferred toolset so we don't waste time researching multiple times, or diverge too far across our services.
* __Links__
  We link to existing guidance where appropriate. E.g. UK Government, NHS, NCSC and worldwide SME authorities such as OWASP.
  We avoid linking to other organisations where the content is specific to them.  

## What shouldn't be in the playbook?

* Confidential information
  This includes Personally Identifiable Information such as names and email addresses
  Provide links to confidential content on the NHSBSA intranet (The Hub)
* Project specific information
  Every project team maintains their own project documentation. This is not that.
* In depth analysis and decision logs
  The playbook contains how we do things, now. It doesn't need to say how we got there.

## How do I decide?

Follow our [suggest a change](../how-to-contribute/github-issues/) guide that explains how we use Github Issues to discuss whether content should be added to the playbook.
