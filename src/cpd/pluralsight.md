NHSBSA Digital have licences for accessing the online training provider, [Pluralsight][pluralsight].

## Getting access

To get access to Pluralsight, you will need a licence allocating to you.

You may request one by emailing your Team Manager or Professional Lead

## Existing users

If you’ve used Pluralsight before, then you probably don’t want to lose any test results or progress that you’ve made with your existing account.

To reuse your existing account, take these steps before requesting a licence:

* Log in to Pluralsight using your existing account credentials
* Select Account settings from your user icon, top right
* Under Email address, select Add email
* Enter your nhs.net email address, and click Send verification
* Go to your nhsmail and click on the verification link

You’ve now linked your NHSMail email address to your account, so when you get a licence from the NHSBSA subscription, you will keep your existing account, and all of your history

## Role-IQ

Pluralsight offers a very useful feature called _Role-IQ_. This allows you to select a job role from a set of common roles in the IT industry, such as Java Developer or Node Web Developer. Pluralsight then provides a series of tests in subject areas relevant to your role. For instance, Java Developer has these tests:

* Java Programming Paradigms
* Java Fundamentals
* Java: Design Patterns
* Java Tooling
* Clean Code Practices in Java
* Java Testing
* Java XML
* Java Networking and HTTP
* Java Application Security
* Git
* JSON

By taking the tests, you will see what you don’t know, and you can go research them. Pluralsight will even suggest appropriate courses that you can take in order to improve your knowledge in areas that you were weakest in.

Role-IQ doesn’t cover all roles. If your role is not covered, then seek assistance from your professional lead: They may be able to suggest individual Skill-IQ tests for you.
