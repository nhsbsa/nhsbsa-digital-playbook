The Power BI Template should be used for any reports or dashboards built in the NHS Business Services Authority. It can be [opened by internal users from SharePoint.][template]  
  
## Using the template  
  
There are 2 methods of using the template:  
  
1. Creating a new report
2. Applying the template to an existing report  
  
Both methods can be used for all Power BI connection modes.  
  
[The instructions for internal users using the template can be found on My Hub][instructions].

## Benefits of using the Power BI Template  
  
Benefits of using the Power BI Template include:  
  
- standardisation of our products and consistent user experience, resulting in increased quality and trust in our products
- saving development time, due to ease of using the template  
  
!!! warning Important
The NHS Toolkit and NHSBSA Data Visualisation Standards would be met for the colour scheme and general layout using the template, but other decisions aligning to the standards will still need to be made.
!!!  
  
## Accompanying standards  
  
The template is a good starting point, but the NHSBSA Data Visualisation Standards still need to be checked when developing a Power BI report.  
Some examples of standards that will need to be checked are:    
  
- no more than four categories on certain charts
- context is given alongside the data
- chart titles and labels are worded appropriately
- focus is pulled to the relevant aspects  
  
The template should be used alongside the:  
  
- NHSBSA Data Visualisation Standards
- NHSBSA Producing Quality Analysis Standards
- NHSBSA Testing framework
- NHSBSA Content Design Standards  
  
Accessibility standards and overall testing will still need to take place when using the template.
