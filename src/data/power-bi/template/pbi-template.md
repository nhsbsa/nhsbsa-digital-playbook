The [Power BI Template][template] should be used for any reports or dashboards built.  
  
## Using the template  
  
There are 2 methods of using the template:  
  
1. Creating a new report
2. Applying the template to an existing report  
  
Both methods can be used for all Power BI connection modes.  
  
[The instructions for using the template can be found on My Hub][instructions].   
  
## Benefits of using the Power BI Template  
  
The benefits of using the Power BI Template include:  
  
- standardisation in the design of our products, using the NHS Toolkit and Data Vsualisation Standards
- implementation of best practice, including accessiblility fixes
- quality and trust in our products
- enabling quicker development times
- increased efficiencies
- ease of use  
  
!!! warning Important
The NHS Toolkit and Data Visualisation Standards would be met for the colour scheme and general layout using the template, but other decisions alining to the standards will still need to be made.
!!!  
  
## Accompanying standards  
  
The template is a good starting point, but the Data Visualisation Standards still need to be checked.  
Some aspects that will need to be checked, even when using the template, are:  
  
- no more than four categories on certain charts
- context is given alongside the data
- chart titles and labels are worded appropriately
- non-functional requirements (NFRs) are accounted for, such as reducing performance times
- focus is pulled to the relevant aspects needed to be highlighted.  

The template should be used alongside the:  
  
- Data Visualisation Standards
- Producing Quality Analysis Standards
- NHSBSA Testing framework
- Content Design Standards  
  
Accessibility standards and overall testing will still need to take place.
