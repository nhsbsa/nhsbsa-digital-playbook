## Sequential data  
  
Sequential data is any data where the order has some meaning such as age groups. 

When presenting sequential data, it is best to use a single hue or small set of closely related hues.  
  
Sequential data should use our primary colour, NHS Blue (#005EB8). Do not alternate between different hues, but make sure that shades go from pale to dark. Colours should progress in the direction a user would expect. For example, for a line chart tracking age groups over time, a lighter colour should be used to represent  younger citizens, and a darker colour for older citizens.
