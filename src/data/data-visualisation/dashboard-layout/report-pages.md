## Reporting pages  
  
The layout of the reporting pages are used as a guide of what a layout could look like.  

### General layout  
  
Features of the reporting pages include the following:

- A filter section: in the example shown this is on the left. Filters as best practice should either be on the left-hand side or as a banner across the top of the page. Considerations on the real estate of the page are important to consider in placing filters. Global filters should be prioritised and included first in this section, with more specific filters following below. Specific filters relating to a singular chart should be placed close to the chart on the right-hand side opposite the title of the chart. Please consult the filter guidance for further information.
- A separation line has been included to clearly define sections.  
  
### Summary/highlights section  
  
The summary/highlights section should be a straightforward summary page which informs the user of key insights and important insights to note.  
  
The example template includes the following:

- KPI cards for some initial summary statistics.
- A sensible header layout, following the visual hierarchy. For example, header 1 then header 2 within the same section.
- Charts should help give further information to the summary statistics shown.
- There should be a prompt to look further into the details of the data, helping to guide the user on their journey.
