To help ensure the user can get as much benefit as possible from a data visualisation product, you should:  
  
- develop with the requirements and audience needs in mind
- consider how your audience will use the data and let that inform how you present it 
- choose the most appropriate data visualisation product or chart type (refer to the [Chart types guidance](../chart-types/) and [Tables guidance](../../tables/) for more information)
- keep visualisations as simple as possible
- direct the user to the most important information using details like colour, size, fonts, and graphics (refer to the [Decluttering and pulling focus guidance](../../decluttering/) for more information)
- provide context for the user, including additional information such as definitions of acronyms
- include short narratives highlighting the key insights, to help the user understand the data 
- align displays of information horizontally and vertically so it can be accurately compared 
- choose colour combinations carefully to avoid confusing users (refer to the [Colour guidance](../../colour/colour-guidance/) for more information) 
- give charts and graphs useful titles that help explain the focus of the visualisation, utilising the title hierarchy so all users can navigate efficiently (refer to the [Chart titles, labels and legends guidance](../titles-labels-legends/) and the [Data accessibility guidance](../../accessibility/data-a11y/) for more information)
- label the axis of a graph or chart clearly, starting at zero unless you have a strong reason not to (for example, if all the data is clustered at much higher values and it would not be misleading to focus in on this content)
- make sure values have an appropriate level of precision to help users understand the figures shown (refer to the [Data Accessibility guidance](../../accessibility/data-a11y/) for more information) 
- make sure any interactive elements are accessible and it is clear to users how to interact with them (refer to the [Data Accessibility guidance](../../accessibility/data-a11y/) for more information) 
- always provide an alternative format to charts, to make sure all users can access the information (refer to the [Data accessibility guidance](../../accessibility/data-a11y/) for more information or the [Gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/examples-of-visual-content-to-use-on-govuk/examples-of-visual-content-to-use-on-govuk#bar-charts) for an example)
