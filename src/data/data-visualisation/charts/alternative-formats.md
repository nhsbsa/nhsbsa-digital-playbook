People who can't understand, interpret or see a chart clearly need an alternative to understand the content.  
  
There should be an alternative format of viewing the data. This could be a link to the data, a download, or a toggle to see the data in a table format.  
  
Some visualisation software include these functions by default.  
  
Alternative text should be available for all charts, or a description of the chart should be in place.  
The alternative text should describe the data being shown.  
  
Chart descriptions can be auto generated, if the text is appropriate. They should be placed after the chart itself. This is to ensure that screen reader users are informed of the chart.
