The requirements and purpose of your product helps define the type of analysis needed, and the types of visuals which will be used.  
  
## Data Analysis types  
  
There are 4 main types of data analysis:  
  
- Descriptive 
- Diagnostic 
- Predictive 
- Prescriptive  
  
Knowing which analysis type is best for your users depends on several factors including who your users are, the decisions they will need to make, and how far into the data they need to investigate. This is something you will need to consider before creating a data product, as it will affect how the data is modelled, charts chosen, and the layout and navigation of a data visualisation. The requirements of the user should help inform this decision.  
  
### Descriptive analysis – what is happening?  
  
Descriptive analysis is the simplest analysis, and can be useful to give quick, quantitative data. Descriptive analysis often focuses on historical data to give a picture of the present. 

### Diagnostic analysis – why is it happening? 

Diagnostic analysis investigates the root cause of data outcomes and events, and uses further data to help inform the insights generated. Within a data product, this may look likebe shown using a drill down function to reveal further details. It is useful to investigate patterns and trends in the data. 
  
### Predictive analysis – what is likely to happen? 

Predictive analysis looks at what the data has been historically telling us,uses historical data and relationships within the data, to inform predict what future outcomes could be. Statistical methods, machine learning and time series analysis can be used to generate these insights. This is most appropriate when business strategies have remained fairly consistent over time.
