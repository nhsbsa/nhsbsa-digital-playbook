## Choosing between a table or a chart  
  
Both tables and charts can be an appropriate way to present your data.  
Charts are often used to visualise patterns, trends, and relationships. Tables are often used to present precise data. 
  
A table may be best if:

- users need to look up specific information
- users need to see exact data
- you do not need to show a pattern
- users need to compare data in two directions
- you need to show rankings of data  
  
A chart may be best if:

- you want to show an overview of data
- you want to show patterns, trends or relationships in data  
  
Although this guidance talks about the comparison of tables to charts, it is important to note that for accessibility purposes it is useful to include an option for the user to switch between a table and chart.

## Accessibility  
  
When presenting your data, it's also important to consider what method is most accessible for users. Both tables and charts have accessibility issues.  
  
These could include: 

- content not fitting on mobile device screens 
- content not adapting correctly when using screen magnifiers 
- content not being read out in a logical order when using screen reader technology  
  
If charts are presented as an image or PDF, this is also inaccessible as visually impaired users may be unable to access this content.  
  
Think about alternative ways of presenting your data. For example, a bulleted list or subheadings.
