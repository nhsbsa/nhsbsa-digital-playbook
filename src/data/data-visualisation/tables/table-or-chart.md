## Choosing between a table or a chart  
  
Both tables and charts can be a good way to present your data.  
Charts are often used to visualise patterns, trends, and relationships. Tables are often used to present precise data. 
  
Some key questions to ask yourself when deciding which to use are:  

- do individual values need to be looked up?
- do individual values need to be compared?
- are precise values needed?
- are different units of measurements to be used?
- is the trend or shape of the values important?
- does the relationship between multiple values need to be shown?  
  
Although this guidance talks about the comparison of tables to charts, it is important to note that for accessibility purposes it is useful to include an option for the user to switch between a table and chart.  
  
There are several occasions where you may wish to use a table. For example, use tables:  
  
- **if you want to enable readers to look up specific information.**
    - Readers can use the table to pinpoint information of interest
    - This information is more accessible than in a body of text. You should only use them to present data, not large amounts of text
- **if precise numbers are important.**
    - Readers may need to know a certain level of accuracy, especially when acting on the data
- **if you do not need to show a pattern.**
    - Tables are useful if the data is sequential
    - Charts are useful to show specific patterns in the data. Use charts instead of tables if you want to give an overview of your numerical data or show a pattern
- **for data we are used to reading.**
    - If the data is simple to the user to look at and understand, and if charts might detract from the message
- **if your readers should compare data in two directions.**
    - To enable your readers to compare multiple categories, sometimes a table is the simplest way
    - You can implement visual encoding such as a heatmap to help users
- **to show ranks.**
    - Ranks clearly enable users to determine the ranking of multiple values without the need for visualising distance as in some charts

## Table alternatives  
  
Try to avoid using tables as they do not work particularly well on mobile devices. Some smaller devices may struggle to fit content into the space on the screen.  
  
Think about alternatives you could use â€“ a bulleted list, a chart or content under subheadings.
