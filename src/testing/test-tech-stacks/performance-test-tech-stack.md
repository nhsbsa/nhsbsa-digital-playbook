### Performance Test

- All our performance testing is performed using the free open source JMeter tool.
This is available from the [JMeter website](https://jmeter.apache.org/).

- No other performance test tools should be used for performance testing.

Please ensure you have read and understand the NHSBSA [Performance Test Strategy](https://bsa2468.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CoP/pages/3235348772/NHSBSA+TEST+STRATEGIES) before starting any performance testing.
