### Accessibility Test

- All of our accessibility testing must adhere to using the following tools, technologies and using the NHSBSA accessibility toolkit. 

#### Automation - checkers 

- Wave (free open source chrome or firefox plugin).
- Axe (free open source chrome or firefox plugin).
- Lighthouse (free open source chrome or firefox plugin)).

#### Assistive Technologies

- Screen Readers: Mac based Voice Over (free pre-installed on macOS) and Windows based NVDA (free open source).
- Speech Recognition: Mac based Voice Control (free pre-installed on macOS) and Windows based Dragon (licensed, please contact test lead).

#### Out of scope for acceptance testing

We do not promote or support the usage of the following:

- Any other automated checkers, the tools above have been chosen due to their accuracy, support and fit. 
- Any other screen reader or speech recognition tool. There are many different versions of these tools but these have been recommended by DAC and are part of the GDS test coverage. Using other versions may also affect our coverage and quality of this testing.
