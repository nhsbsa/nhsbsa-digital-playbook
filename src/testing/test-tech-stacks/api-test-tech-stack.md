### API Test

- All our API testing is performed using the free open source Karate tool.
This is available from the [Karate website](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate).

- All API tests must be run through automated Karate tests. Manual API tests should not be used as a substitute.

- No other API test tools should be used for API testing.
