## Checklists

To widen our testing coverage we manually check on various accessibility focus areas where accessibility issues are likely to occur or where we have encountered either WCAG conflicts or issues from audits. 

### Manual Checklist 
Accessibility of a service is more than just complying to the legal guidelines, we also have to ensure our users can use the service without having any problems. 

This checklist compromises of 28 areas including non java script operation, titles, urls and tab indexes where manual tests can identify issues that would affect the usability of a service but are still within the scope of WCAG guidelines.

### Screen Reader Checklist

To complement the manual and automated checks we also use assistive technologies to test if the services work and operate correctly for users of screen readers, speech recognition or screen magnifiers.

These tests including a checklist for screen readers to look into accessibility focus areas as well as testing representative user journeys with assistive technologies.

We use the following assistive technologies to test our services:

- Screen Readers (NVDA on Windows and Voice Over on Macs)
- Speech Recognition (Dragon on Windows and Voice Control on Macs)
- Screen Magnifiers (Zoom and magnifers on both machine types)
