## Why do we have a test tech stack?

A tech stack is a combination and mix of tools and technologies that the NHSBSA test community uses to test all of our services. 
The test tech stack is our assurance to use tools and technologies that add benefits to our work in terms of value and fit. These tools and technologies are supported by the NHSBSA both in technical and skills terms and also complement, maintain and improve our core test frameworks.

## What is the tech stack?
