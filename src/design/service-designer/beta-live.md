## What is expected from a Service Designer in Beta and Live

During the Beta / Live phases, the product is closer to its final form, and the focus is on refining and optimising the user experience. The delivery team normally expands in size during the beta phase, and reduces again for live. During these two phases, the need for service design to be directive/ transformative is reduced and the need for interaction design is increased, you may see the need for Senior Service Designer be reduced down to a Midweight Service Designer to maintain blueprints and monitor the service, and the need may be removed completely for live. As a Service Designer, you might be involved in:

- implementing the agreed service design structure and testing it for real with a select group of users (this is known as Private Beta)
- working with the whole team to decide whether identified snags need to be further tested or can be shipped and measured with consideration for risk and process delivery, i.e. customer satisfaction, assisted digital legalities with accessibility and inclusivity and or any cost implications 
- identifying gaps and working with others to implement the agreed service structure 
- ensuring that solutions are built for everyone - not just a select few
- ensuring that solutions meet the WCAG 2.2 AA standard
- contributing and sharing any new process or operations that can be reused in other services across the BSA or wider within cross-gov 
- observing user research and analysing data and analytics
- documenting the changes to the service over time using a UCD Log i.e. what was created and why, and what did you find, was this what you expected? What next?
