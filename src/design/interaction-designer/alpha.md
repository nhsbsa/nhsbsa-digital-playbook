## What is expected from an Interaction Designer in Alpha

In the Alpha phase, the team aims to develop and refine early versions of the product or service. As an Interaction Designer, your key responsibilities might involve:

- collaborating with cross-functional team members (user researchers, developers, business analysts, product owners, etc.) to refine design concepts based on user feedback.
- prototyping journeys (including out of service and colleague facing as required) that test risky assumptions in as high fidelity as is appropriate, champion focused design work based on hypotheses
- creating user journeys that are simple to use and understand, and based on research
- creating a consistent user experience with other NHS / GOV services
- considering all routes that users take to the service
- considering the context of each user group i.e. how the service will look and work on every browser or device users access it on
- documenting the changes to the service over time using a UCD log i.e. what was created and why, what you planned to test (hypothesis) and what did you find
