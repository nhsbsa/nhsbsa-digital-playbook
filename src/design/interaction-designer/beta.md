## What is expected from an Interaction Designer in Beta

During the Beta phase, the product is closer to its final form, and the focus is on refining and optimising the user experience. As an Interaction Designer, you might be involved in:

- taking your best idea from alpha and start building it for real with a select group of users (this is known as Private Beta)
- working with the team to decide whether changes need to be usability tested or can be shipped and measured
- helping track down work to be done based on user feedback
- ensuring that solutions are built for everyone - not just a select few
- ensuring that solutions meet the WCAG 2.2 AA standard
- contributing and sharing any new design patterns that are developed to meet user needs within the NHS / GOV design communities
- observing user research and analysing data and analytics
- documenting the changes to the service over time using a UCD log i.e. what was created and why, what you planned to test (hypothesis) and what did you find
