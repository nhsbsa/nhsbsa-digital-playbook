## What is expected from an Interaction Designer in Live

During the Live phase, the product is in its final form, and the focus is on refining and optimising the user experience. As an Interaction Designer, you might be involved in:

- helping track down work to be done based on user feedback
- ensuring that solutions are built for everyone - not just a select few
- ensuring that solutions meet the [latest published WCAG standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) to 'AA' standard
- contributing and sharing any new design patterns that are developed to meet user needs within the NHS / GOV design communities
- observing user research and analysing data and analytics
- documenting the changes to the service over time using a UCD log i.e. what was created and why, what you planned to test (hypothesis) and what did you find
