## What a content designer does

Content designs answer a user need in the best way for the user to consume it.​

It:​

- allows someone to find something quickly and easily​
- is not just about writing web copy​
- can take a range of formats​
- should be based on research​

### Content designers are responsible for:

Content across our digital services, corporate website and digital collaboration platforms (SharePoint, Yammer)

- Making sure content is: 
- compliant with GDS
- follows accessibility guidelines (WCAG)
- is designed responsively
- easy to understand

### Content designers do not:

- Own content
- write content from scratch, unless it’s generic content which can be universally found in design patterns. Instead, content designers will work with raw content or placeholder research/key themes to refine it into something that is fit for purpose
- code prototypes
- create offline content, such as leaflets, factsheets or correspondence, as these types of content follow different guidelines (GCS), which our communications team are responsible for

## Content design principles

### 1. Keep the user in mind

We need to:

- understand who the users are
- whether users will understand the content
- know what the user needs to do or what they need to get at the end of the journey

### 2. Requirement for new content

A requirement for new content will generally be driven by user research or by business direction.

For new content driven by user research, the source of requirement is either:

- users
- subject matter experts

For new content driven by business direction, the source of requirement is either:

- subject matter experts
- stakeholders
- business analysts

### 3. Design process

Content designers will work in collaboration with interaction/UX/service designers to write content that is:

- in line with GDS standards
- in line with accessibility guidelines (WCAG)
- designed responsively
- accurate in spelling and grammar

Content designers will work in collaboration with subject matter experts/stakeholders/product owners to write content that is:

- factually, procedurally and technically correct
- meets business requirement

### 4. Build, analyse and iterate

At this point, content will be built into a prototype, then eventually into development stage.

All elements of design, including the content, will then be tested with users. This will usually loop the whole process around in iteration with further new content requirements, being driven from user research.

Alternatively, if the product goes live, all elements of design, including the content, will go into continuous improvements. Depending on business direction, this could loop further iterations.
