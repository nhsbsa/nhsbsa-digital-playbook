## What is expected from a Content Designer in Beta

During the Beta phase, the product is closer to its final form, and the focus is on refining and optimising the user experience. As a Content Designer, you might be involved in:

- make sure all routes that users take into the service are now considered as valid end-to-end user journeys
- taking your best idea from alpha and start building it for real with a select group of users (this is known as Private Beta)
- working with the team to decide whether further changes are required to fine tune the final product
- helping track down work to be done based on user feedback
- ensuring that solutions are built for everyone - not just a select few
- ensuring that solutions meet the WCAG 2.2 AA standard
- contributing and sharing any new design patterns that are developed to meet user needs within the NHS / GOV design communities
- observing user research and analysing data and analytics
