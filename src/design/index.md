## What different design roles exist at the NHSBSA?

The NHSBSA follows the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework" target="_blank">DDaT Framework</a> and has 3 types of designer; service designers, interaction designers and content designers.

## Service design

A service designer makes sure we design and deliver the right service. They work in teams that may support multiple products or sub-services. They also work in the space before Discovery shaping and scoping future work.

**Teams**:

Services as end-users would know them transcend delivery or product teams. Service designers work across a program of work to design the interactions and building blocks that make a service. The service designer may support multiple product teams to provide insight on how to achieve desired outcomes in a measurable way. 

**Scoping**:

This stage is about establishing the problem / costs / issues that you want to look at including the people and skills you are likely to need for Discovery. A service designer will work with the business and policy upfront to understand what we have, define the problem(s) to be solved, and the desired outcome(s).

### What is service design?  

A design practice that helps organisations understand, visualise and orchestrate all the different components of a service e.g. people, digital services, comms, processes and aligns them with the end user’s needs. This is done in order that service provides the best possible outcomes for the organisation, its stakeholders and its end users.

### Why do it?

By working across organisational boundaries, service design helps users complete their goals by solving problems that sit outside the normal remit of interaction and content design.

**Service design**:

 * Builds context and understanding of end users lives
 * Brings visibility to customer journeys and the pain points that limit service use
 * Highlights organisational / structural issues that prevent good service outcomes

Service design along with other disciplines will help us create services that:

 * Are easy to find
 * Clearly explain the purpose of the service
 * Set expectations a user has of the service
 * Enable each user to complete the outcome they set out to do
 * Work in a way that is familiar
 * Require no prior knowledge to use
 * Are agnostic of organisational structures
 * Require the minimum possible steps to complete
 * Are consistent throughout
 * Have no dead ends
 * Are usable by everyone, equally
 * Encourage the right behaviours from users and service providers
 * Respond to change quickly
 * Clearly explain why a decision has been made
 * Make it easy to get human assistance

### When to do it

Service design is applicable throughout the agile delivery phases Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live (as defined by GDS). In addition it is valuable to use service design approaches in pre-discovery in order to diagnose and scope out the problems that need to be addressed. Often requests are made to build defined things i.e. an app, a page, a service which presuppose a solution, working pre discovery allows stakeholders to avoid this issue with good problem definition.

### Benefits

Service design supports digital design to ensure benefits can be realised

 * Reduces risk by ensuring the right problem is solved
 * Creates efficiencies by identifying service siloes, duplication and proliferation
 * Ensures user and stakeholder outcomes are designed into the service

 ### Example

| Type of design | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Service design | Manage a waste removal company |

## Interaction design

An interaction designer designs how things should work, they remove risk by testing ideas early and often with real users.

### What is interaction design?

A design practice that works out the best way to let users interact with a product or sub-service. This is done to make sure we create inclusive and accessible products that can be used by all people

### Why do it?

Interaction design removes the risk of developing systems that don't meet user needs by:

 * Testing assumptions, hypothesis, and designs early and often
 * ensuring the product is inclusive and accessible

Interaction design along with other disciplines helps us create products that:

 * Meet the NHS / Government service standards
 * Meet NHS / Government accessibility regulations
 * Meet current web standards
 * Meet user and organisational needs
 * Are simple and intuitive to use
 * Work in a way that is familiar
 * Require the minimum possible steps to complete
 * Are consistent throughout
 * Are usable by everyone, equally

### When to do it

Interaction design is applicable throughout the agile delivery phases: Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live (as defined by GDS). In addition, interaction designers also work on upgrading legacy applications and rolling out changes to ensure internal NHS services are consistent and meet current standards and regulations.

### Benefits

Interaction design supports digital delivery to ensure benefits can be realised

 * Reduces risk, development and maintenance costs by testing assumptions and hypothesis
 * Improves outcomes by facilitating design sessions to ensure a wide range of possibilities are considered
 * Improves performance and reduces the number of user errors
 * Increases user satisfaction and trust in both the service and the NHS
 * Improves efficiency through consistency and familiarity

### Example

| Type of design | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Interaction design | Apply for a waste Carrier, Broker or Dealer permit |
| Interaction design | Apply for a standard rules waste Permit |

## Content design

### What is content design?

Content design is answering a user need in the best way for the user to consume it.

It:

* allows someone to find something quickly and easily
* is not just about writing web copy
* can take a range of formats
* should be based on research

### Why do it?

Good content design:

* helps people get the information they need in a way they expect
* focuses on the user needs by creating content that is simple and easy to understand
* makes sure content is accessible and inclusive for anyone who needs it
* keeps content across multiple services consistent by following standards set out in our style guide
* gives our users the best possible experience of our services and reduces workloads for areas of the business

### When to do it

Content design should work alongside the other professions in the UCD team, throughout the whole design journey.

Throughout this process we should test and iterate content design based on research, data and evidence.

It should also be done proactively to identify any improvements that could be made.

### Benefits

So that the user: 

* is able to access information quickly
* understands the subject matter 
* isn’t excluded
* gets the outcome they need 

### Example

A good example of how content design can help can be found in the Manage your service (MYS) portal.
