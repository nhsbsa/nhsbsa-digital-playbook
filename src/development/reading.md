## Clean code

> "Clean code is code that has been taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared."
> â€• Robert C. Martin

We advise all developers to read the seminal book _[Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship][goodreads_cleancode]_ by Robert C. Martin.

## Code smells and refactoring

Kent Beck coined the term _code smell_ to refer to problems with code that are easy to spot, easy to fix but can signify more serious underlying problems. Martin Fowler described a set of standard code smells and associated patterns to refactor code and fix them.

We advise all developers to read Martin Fowler's book _[Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code][goodreads_refactoring]_.

Alternatively, visit the wonderful [Refactoring][refactoring_guru] website that covers code smells and refactors in an engaging format.
