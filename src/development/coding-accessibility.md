Developers are essential to making NHSBSA services accessible. Accessibility must be built in from the start.

Accessible services help everyone and reduce technical debt. It is always faster and cheaper to fix issues early.

NHS Frontend components are designed and tested for accessibility, but they do not guarantee WCAG 2.2 AA compliance. You must still implement them correctly and test your pages before publishing.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
WCAG is a list of success criteria your website or mobile application need to meet to be legally compliant with the accessibility regulations. The latest published version of WCAG is [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).

At a minimum our services need to meet WCAG 2.2 to Level AA standard. There are 55 success criteria that your websites will need to meet. You can read more about WCAG on our [Accessibility playbook page](/nhsbsa-digital-playbook/accessibility/).

For further guidance on meeting the WCAG 2.2 success criteria, see:
- [GOV.UK accessibility testing guide](https://github.com/alphagov/wcag-primer/wiki)
- [Department for Education WCAG explorer](https://accessibility.education.gov.uk/guidelines/wcag/explorer)
- [How to meet WCAG (Quick reference) - W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref)
- [The NHS accessibility checklist and guidance for developers](https://nhsdigital.github.io/accessibility-checklist/checklist-developer/)

## Existing patterns and components
Always start by using the existing patterns and components in the [NHS Design System](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) and the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

These components often have accessibility considerations built in, so it’s not enough to just style your components to look similar.

You should work with an interaction designer to understand what parts of the design exist already. If you need to build something from scratch you will need to do additional work to make sure it’s accessible.

### Pattern libraries
When using the NHS Frontend, the GOV.UK Design System can help you check which HTML attributes you need to make components accessible. 

For example, when building an email input, you can use the [NHS text input component](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/text-input), then check the [GOV.UK email address pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/email-addresses/) to make sure you’re using the correct HTML attributes such as `type` and `autocomplete`.

Use the NHS and GOV.UK pattern libraries to check components and find best practice examples:
- [NHS Design system patterns](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/patterns)
- [GOV.UK Design system patterns](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/)

## Understanding the accessibility tree
Assistive technologies use the [accessibility tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree) to understand your page. The tree shows the **roles**, **names**, **states** and **properties** exposed by your code.

Use your browser’s developer tools to inspect the accessibility tree. This helps you check:
- components have the correct roles
- names and descriptions are correctly exposed as expected
- interactive elements appear in the correct order
- ARIA attributes follow best practice and do not replace semantic HTML

Checking the accessibility tree early can help you find issues that automated tools miss.

## Creating new components
Sometimes you will need to create new components. New components must to be researched, designed and developed to be accessible from the start. 

Use your browser’s developer tools to inspect your component in the accessibility tree. Make sure it exposes the correct roles, names, states and properties so assistive technologies interpret it correctly.

Test every new component to make sure it:
- works with assistive technologies, including screen readers, magnifiers and voice control
- works with keyboard-only navigation
- works with zoom, reflow and large text
- does not rely on colour alone to convey information
- has clear and consistent focus styles
- behaves predictably and consistently across devices and browsers

You are responsible for ensuring the component meets WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

For examples of common accessibility issues, read the [10 digital accessibility mistakes to avoid](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2025/02/04/10-digital-accessibility-mistakes-to-avoid/) on the GOV.UK blog.

## Consider accessibility when using Copilot
If you use code generated by Copilot (or any AI-assisted tool), review it with accessibility in mind. Automated suggestions might feel like they speed up development, but there is no guarantee the output meets accessibility requirements, and fixing accessibility issues later will slow you down.

WebAIM found WCAG failures on 94.8% of the top one million homepages. If Large Language Models (LLMs) learn from inaccessible websites, we cannot assume AI-generated code will be accessible.

You must:
- treat AI-generated output as a first draft, not a guarantee of accessibility
- review code using tools like HTML validators, accessibility checkers and browser accessibility trees
- use the automated and manual checks in this playbook to validate output against WCAG before you push to test


## Accessibility checks before pushing code
After writing code, check that your work meets accessibility standards. Use the [NHS developer accessibility checklist](https://nhsdigital.github.io/accessibility-checklist/checklist-developer/) alongside the checks on this page, including the automated and manual tests listed below.

The following checks apply to all pages and components, whether new or updated.

### Web pages
- page titles are correct and descriptive. Titles must include the page's H1, the service name, and the organisation. For example `Where do you live? - Get healthcare cover for travelling abroad - NHSBSA`
- the page has the correct HTML language set using the `lang` attribute
- semantic HTML elements are used where possible, instead of generic `<div>` or `<span>` tags
- landmark regions are used correctly to support screen reader navigation
- skip links are present and work as expected
- URLs are clear, unambiguous, easy to read, and easy to share
- link text is descriptive and meaningful, without needing surrounding text
- headings follow a logical hierarchy
- if your service times users out, use the NHSBSA timeout component to warn users and give them time to extend their session
- ensure touch targets meet minimum size and spacing
- check the HTML for duplicate IDs, as these can break form error linking and assistive technology support

### Form fields and inputs
- every form input has the correct label, type, and autocomplete attributes
- related inputs are grouped using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` where appropriate
- error messages are implemented correctly and linked to inputs or fieldsets using `aria-describedby`
- components expose the correct roles, states, and properties in the accessibility tree

### Colour and visual design
- information is never conveyed by colour alone
- make sure colour contrast ratios meet accessibility standards; you can check them using a [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- avoid using block capitals for headings or large sections of text

### Interaction and navigation
Before pushing your code, you must check your pages:
- with a screen reader
- with keyboard-only navigation, check there are no traps, all interactive elements can be reached, and focus follows a clear, logical order
- at 400% zoom using a browser window of 1280 px × 1024 px to check that content reflows 
- to confirm focus order and keyboard navigation behave as expected

### Images and media
- images have meaningful alt text that describes the purpose of the image
- decorative images use empty alt text `(alt="")`
- videos include captions
- audio content has a transcript
- complex images, such as charts or diagrams, include a text alternative that conveys the same information

### Automated and technical checks
Automated tools don’t catch every issue, but used alongside manual testing they provide good coverage.

Test your pages with these tools before committing or deploying:
- [axe DevTools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
- [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)
- [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)

## Prioritising fixes
Fix all accessibility issues before you push code to test. If issues are found later in the process, prioritise the ones that block people from completing essential tasks, such as filling in forms or navigating the service.

## Working with others
- collaborate with interaction and content designers to make sure designs translate into accessible code
- pair with testers so accessibility checks are included as part of the definition of done
- work with business analysts to make sure accessibility requirements are captured early, including things like page titles and error messages
