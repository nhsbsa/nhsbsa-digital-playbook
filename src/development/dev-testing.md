## Test scope for developers

Developers are responsible for testing the code they write. We require two types of test as a minimum:

__Unit test__
:   A self contained test for a unit of functionality, such as a Java class or a Javascript file.

__Integration test__
:   A test for a unit of functionality that depends on an external resource, such as a database.
