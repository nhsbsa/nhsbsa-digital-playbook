Design is how it works. Steve Jobs What is design There are lots of different kinds of design, within the NHSBSA we have: Service Designers (link) Interaction Designers (link) Content Designers (link) What they all have in common, is that the designer takes time to understand the problem they\u2019re faced with from a range of perspectives, before they create a solution. The Design Council\u2019s Double Diamond model is a visual diagram showing these design stages. The Double Diamond shows the importance of taking time to understand the problem before designing solutions. Each diamond shape illustrates the process of creating or exploring many possible ideas before refining these to the best idea. The first diamond does this to confirm the problem, and the second to design the solution.

We maintain a sustainable pace of productivity, and full lives outside of work. We maximize our ability to take on any project by creating a diverse team who can bring their experience and perspectives together to solve problems. We are proud of the work we are doing, and believe that it is meaningful, worth existing, and improves society and human well-being. Self-Management We are able to manage ourselves and don't need someone to tell us what to do in order to be productive. Our first instinct is to take initiative rather than expect a policy or ask for permission. We are able to make decisions on our own, to initiate change, and to take action independently. Taking action independently doesn't mean we do everything alone. Rather, that we know when to collaborate, and when to ask for help. Continuous Improvement We recognise that we can always be better. Therefore, we have strong opinions, loosely held, and take initiative to improve ourselves, the company, and our community. This is a never-ending task, because there is always room for improvement. This week should be better than last, and we should be optimistic that next week will be better than this week. We learn new things, and share those things with our peers and community. While continually working to make things better, we prefer long-term viability over near-term shortcuts. It is more important that the organization exist in five years than it is that we make an extra dollar this year. Trust We expect the best from each other, give each other the benefit of the doubt, encourage each other to take initiative to improve ourselves and the company, and provide direct and constructive help to each other. We show trust and respect for each other by telling the truth, and demonstrate honesty and integrity in our actions. We avoid having private conversations about each other or clients. Instead, we talk in person, and use tools such as Slack, Basecamp, and GitHub to communicate openly within a project, within thoughtbot, and publicly. We want to be able to choose our own tools and bring a respected voice to the way our projects are run. We are not in the room to take orders, we're in the room to collaborate and solve problems. We insist on working for clients who trust our role and experience. We prefer transparency of information whenever possible. We do all of this while maintaining the privacy and confidentiality that every person deserves. Quality We create working, maintainable, and understandable software that is enjoyable and easy to use. We improve the quality of the process and the client's environment. Beyond that, designing and building quality software means improving the security, privacy, and accessibility of the product, and includes improvements of life and reduction of harm for all users and contributors.","title":"Values"},{"location":"values/#values","text":"","title":"Values"},{"location":"values/#fulfilment","text":"We maintain an inclusive environment where we can thrive professionally and personally.
