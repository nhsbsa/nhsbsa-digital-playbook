<h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The below guidance has been written to help interaction designers in completing and supporting their service teamâ€™s User Centred Design log. This is a general guide to best practice and any specific service questions must be raised with the service team.</p>
<p>The log will be used to inform the reader about the interaction design activity undertaken and the outcomes of that work. It is important that you as a designer ensure that there are no knowledge gaps within your log so that it can be used to support any new team member onboarding the service team, particularly those who will be joining the UCD team. It will also provide valuable information in supporting a project service assessment.</p>
<p>The following information outlines the steps you should take to create your design log entry.</p>
<h2 id="sample-file-structure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sample-file-structure">Sample file structure</a></h2>
<p>A standard file structure will help us ensure that logs from different services remain consistent, making it easier for people to find the logs if they switch projects.</p>
<p>The agreed structure is:<br>
<code class="md">Service &gt; Phase &gt; Functionality/block of research &gt; Date entry covers &gt; UR/design entry</code></p>
<p>So that becomes, for example:<br>
<code class="md">NHS Jobs &gt; Public beta &gt; Search function &gt; June â€“ August 2021 &gt; Interaction Design</code></p>
<h2 id="headings-to-structure-your-ucd-log" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#headings-to-structure-your-ucd-log">Headings to Structure your UCD log</a></h2>
<p>In this section of the guidance, you will see how you can structure the UCD log and what you can document for each section.</p>
<p>As part of an introduction to the UCD log, include a relevant title for which is a summary of the work being discussed, you should also provide your name, email address and date to keep an audit of the work completed, but also to allow for any readers to reach out with any questions they may have.</p>
<p>Below are headings you can use to structure your log and what could be part of each section.</p>
<h3 id="why-we-did-this-work" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-we-did-this-work">Why we did this work</a></h3>
<p>If you are working in sprints, it would be beneficial to include the sprint goal and a little background for the sprint to give insight into why this work fits into the sprint goals, if the work is spanning over multiple sprints, then include the sprint numbers as reference.</p>
<p>Provide key findings of the research and discovery work that has been done to determine the design work that has been done, it would be best to keep this minimal as the User Researcher will be going into more depth in their version of the UCD log.</p>
<p>Timelines are an effective way to present the journey the work has taken from initial research to the design, talking through that timeline will give any readers a better understanding of how the work has come about and the reasons behind it, also showing any changes which had impact on the design and how it has iterated.</p>
<p>Insight into your design decisions is key, giving information about your design thinking and how this has reflected in your design ideation will show what has been considered and what may not have been part of those decisions, if work was needed to be revisited then looking through previous decisions could determine what other areas could be looked at.</p>
<h3 id="what-our-ideas-were" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-our-ideas-were">What our ideas were</a></h3>
<p>Information architecture is always worth documenting, providing visuals of these would benefit along with the content of any structure changes and the work done to keep consistency and how the navigation of the service is made easier.</p>
<p>Including all interactions, the user journey should be provided throughout, this again can include visuals, and the flow they take throughout the service.</p>
<p>As part of the ideation, wireframes are always beneficial to document and to show the different ideas that have been thought of and designed into a journey. As part of the wireframes, you should also provide insight into any interface elements you have considered and document how these have also been iterated.</p>
<p>Based on any underlying research, we use <a href="https://medium.com/@andyjones_1981/using-hypothesis-driven-design-and-user-research-to-validate-design-decisions-91acae07fe3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hypothesis driven design</a> to verbalise the ideas we plan to test to solve any underlying problems. You should include these as part of your log e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We believe thatâ€¦</strong> creating this experience<br>
<strong>Will be a useful feature forâ€¦</strong> user<br>
<strong>As it willâ€¦</strong> outcome</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We believe thatâ€¦</strong> allowing applicants to search for their address using their postcode<br>
<strong>Will be a useful feature forâ€¦</strong> all invited applicants<br>
<strong>As it willâ€¦</strong> allow them to complete their application quicker.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-we-tested-them-and-what-we-found" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-we-tested-them-and-what-we-found">How we tested them and what we found</a></h3>
<p>Prototype URLs and version numbers must be provided as part of the UCD log, you should also include any credentials to access this. If your prototype requires specific data to be entered in fields you should also provide information on what questions require certain inputs, sometimes prototypes are set up in a way to follow a persona so any persona details should be included along with credentials.</p>
<p>User testing will provide great feedback on the prototype you have designed, share the key findings of that feedback in the log to show how designs have then been iterated based on evidence from user research, again make sure to summaries these findings as these will be in more depth throughout the User Research log.</p>
<p>Keeping a log of all your changes will allow an audit trail to be kept and history of the progress the design has gone through, keeping a log of any wireframes, user journeys and prototypes will not only benefit the service but people who want to see how the design has progressed over time, provide any relevant URLs to Miro boards and prototypes where any iteration history is documented along with credentials if passwords have been set.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-will-do-next" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-will-do-next">What we will do next</a></h3>
<p>For closing comments on the UCD log, give some information on what the next steps are with this piece of work, are there any further iterations that could be made but may not be as high priority just yet, is there further research to be done on a certain part of the design. Talk about things you were not able to do as part of this design that you want to be raised at a later stage and how this has been documented to be revisited.</p>
<h3 id="resources" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#resources">Resources</a></h3>
<p>Provide any other relevant links to resources that relate to the work this UCD log is based on. Include a small summary of why these resources are relevant.</p>
<p>You may want to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Links to Jira tickets</li>
<li>Miro boards</li>
<li>SharePoint files or folders</li>
<li>Recorded videos</li>
<li>User research feedback</li>
</ul>
