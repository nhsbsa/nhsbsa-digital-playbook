<p>Service Design is a design practice that connects all aspects of a service cross-channel and cross-platform. This may be in the form of on paper, digitally, via telephony or assisted digital routes. This is done to make sure we create a closed loop service that will run smoothly and efficiently across multiple aspects of the business. They will work with Technical Architects, Product Owners, Delivery Managers and other members of the UCD team to steer the project in terms of strategy, efficiency, technology, policy and process.</p>

<ul>
<li>consider the experience of all the people affected by the service.</li>
<li>services should be designed based on creating value for users and customers and to be as efficient as possible.</li>
<li>services should always be designed with input from all users of the service</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-collaborate" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#2-collaborate">2. Collaborate</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>services can and should be prototyped in conjunction with an Interaction Designer and tested by a User Researcher before being developed</li>
<li>services must be designed in conjunction with business need, public policy and available technologies with documented risk and outcomes based on Product Ownership vision for best delivery of the service</li>
<li>services should be designed and delivered in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders (both external and internal)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-iterate" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#3-iterate">3. Iterate</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>service design is an adaptive approach, iterating toward implementation.</li>
<li>services should be developed with minimum viable products (MVPs) in mind for delivery and then deployed. They should then be iterated and improved to add additional value based on user feedback and service data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-be-sequential" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#4-be-sequential">4. Be sequential</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>the service should be visualised and orchestrated as a sequence of interrelated actions.</li>
<li>services should be designed to deliver a unified and efficient system rather than component-by-component which can lead to poor overall service performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-address-real-needs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#5-address-real-needs">5. Address real needs</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>needs should be researched in reality, ideas tested in reality.</li>
<li>always consider equally, people, policy, assets and culture when looking at service transformation and always iterate or adapt based on research and data to help achieve business strategy and goals, documenting how any change would impact all four aspects of the service with risk and outcomes clearly explained.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>services should sustainably address the needs of all stakeholders through the entire service and across the business.</li>
<li>services should be designed based on a genuine comprehension of the purpose of the service, the demand for the service and the ability of the service provider to deliver that service.</li>
<li>services should be designed on the understanding that special events (those that cause variation in general processes) will be treated as common events (and processes should be designed to accommodate them)</li>
<li>all service transformation and adaptation or review should be recommended based on the full service ecosystem and not just one aspect</li>
